# RFM-Clustering

**RFM Clustering with K-Means for Nuorashop Customer Segmentation**

**Introduction**

This project demonstrates RFM analysis and K-means clustering to segment customers of Nuorashop, an online retail store. It utilizes a mock dataset to illustrate the customer segmentation process. The mock dataset is generated by the ```data_generator.py``` script, which simulates Nuorashop customer behavior.

**Understanding RFM Analysis**

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that leverages three key customer behavior metrics:

  * Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase (e.g., days since last purchase)
  * Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases (e.g., number of purchases within a timeframe)
  * Monetary Value: How much a customer spends per purchase (e.g., average order value)
By analyzing these dimensions, you can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation** 

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into a predefined number of clusters (k). It iteratively assigns data points to the closest cluster centroid (mean) and recalculates the centroids until a convergence criterion is met.

In this context, K-means helps you group Nuorashop customers into distinct segments based on their RFM characteristics.

**Implementation**

This project provides Python code to perform RFM clustering on a mock dataset simulating Nuorashop's customer data. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

1. **Data Preparation:**

  * **(Optional)** Generate a mock dataset using ```data_generator.py``` (for illustrative purposes).
  * Load the provided mock dataset (or your actual data loading steps if applicable).
  * Preprocess the data as needed (e.g., handle missing values, outliers).
  * Calculate RFM scores for each customer.
  
2. **Feature Scaling (Optional):**

* K-means is sensitive to the scale of features. If your RFM scores have significantly different scales, consider scaling them (e.g., using standard scaler) to ensure they contribute equally to the distance calculations

3. **Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters (k):**

* Use techniques like the elbow method to identify the "elbow" point in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) vs. number of clusters. This indicates the optimal k where adding more clusters doesn't significantly reduce WCSS.

4. **K-Means Clustering:**

* Import and initialize the K-means algorithm.
* Fit the K-means model to your RFM data with the chosen value of k.

5. **Evaluation and Interpretation:**

* Analyze the resulting clusters and their characteristics based on RFM scores.
* Use visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots) to explore the clusters and identify patterns.

**Project Structure**

```rfm.py```                   ```# The main Python script containing the implementation steps.```  
```data/```                    ```# Directory containing the mock customer transaction data (CSV or other supported format).```  
```sample.json```              ```# The mock dataset for Nuorashop customers.```  

**Dependencies**

This project requires the following Python libraries (install using ```pip install```):

* pandas (data manipulation)
* numpy (numerical computations)
* scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms)
* seaborn (data visualization)

Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. (Optional) Run python ```data_generator.py``` to generate a mock dataset (you can skip this if using your own data).
4. Run python ```rfm.py```.
  * The script will process the mock data (or your data if provided), perform RFM clustering, and potentially generate visualizations.
5. Explore the output (cluster assignments, visualizations) to understand your customer segments in the context of Nuorashop.
